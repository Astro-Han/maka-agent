# Embedded terminal parser

The build embeds the repository-locked `@xterm/headless` 6.0.0 and
`@xterm/addon-unicode11` 0.9.0 in the existing V8 runtime. Node and esbuild are
build-time tools only. The client and server use the same terminal parser and
Unicode tables; Rust owns native processes, resource lifecycle and persistence.
