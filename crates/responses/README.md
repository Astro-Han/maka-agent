# Responses

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Native Rust Responses encoding, stream decoding, and disposable WebSocket continuation state. No V8 dependency. Host owns credentials, request admission, canonical history, and usage settlement.

Inspired by [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/94174e44cbc54cece45f6052328ca0c2cd7a8a2a/codex-rs/codex-api). HTTP and WebSocket share one event decoder; connection caches are optimizations, not replay authorities.
